The matlab<sup>TM</sup> code was written 11 Nov 2022 by Martin Kroger (mk@mat.ethz.ch) and is part of the supplementary information of the following article:

### Visualize a pore for a randomly chosen point *p* inside the benchmark configuration

      code_single_random_pore_for_our_benchmark_from_edges.m
      
Executing this parameter-free code creates a figure that shows the benchmark configuration (a single eventually coated circle, 
subject to periodic boundary conditions). In addition the position of the randomly chosen point (red), enclosed by a red circle 
with a radius of the probe particle, and the pore circle (green, centered at the blue point) calculated by this voronoi-based code.

### Visualize a pore for a randomly chosen point *p* inside the multidisk configuration 

      code_single_random_pore_for_our_multidisk_from_edges.m
      
This code creates a figure that shows the multidisk configuration (20 eventually coated circles, 
subject to periodic boundary conditions). In addition the position of the randomly chosen point (red), enclosed by a red circle 
with a radius of the probe particle, and the pore circle (green, centered at the blue point) calculated by this voronoi-based code.

### Calculate G-PSD for the benchmark

      code_G_PSD_2D_for_our_benchmark.m
      
calculates and displays the voronoi-based G-PSD as well as the cumulative G-PSD for the benchmark. The number of shots (M) is
specified in the file. The result is compared with the analytical result (dashed green).

### Calculate G-PSD for the multidisk

      code_G_PSD_2D_for_our_multidisk.m
      
calculates and displays the voronoi-based G-PSD as well as the cumulative G-PSD for the multidisk with 20 circles. The number of shots (M) is
specified in the file. 

### Calculate G-PSD for user-defined system

The user has to specify box size *L* and *N* material center coordinates *x(1..N,1:2)* as well as the
radius *ro* of a material circle,
thickness *rc* of the material coating, 
radius *rp* of the probe circle, 
number *PSDbins* of bins of the G-PSD,  
number *M* of random shots to calculate the G-PSD. Then call 

       [radius,GPSD,GPSDcum] = code_G_PSD_2D_for_user_defined_system(L,x,ro,rc,rp,shots,PSDbins)
       
The resulting vectors *radius*, *GPSD*, and *GPSDcum* contain radii, the G-PSD, and the cumulative G-PSD. 

Example: 

      L  = 1; 
      dx = 0.1; 
      [X,Y] = meshgrid(-L/2:dx:(L/2-dx),-L/2:dx:(L/2-dx));
      remove = find(sqrt(X.^2+Y.^2)<0.3); 
      X(remove) = [];
      Y(remove) = [];
      x = [X(:) Y(:)];        % matrix with N rows and 2 colunms

      ro = dx/2;
      rc = 0;
      rp = 0;

      shots = 10000;
      PSDbins = 100; 

      [radius,GPSD,GPSDcum] = code_G_PSD_2D_for_user_defined_system(L,x,ro,rc,rp,shots,PSDbins);
      
      figure; 
      plot(radius,GPSDcum,'k.-'); 
      xlabel('r');
      ylabel('P_{cum}(r|0)')
